What is Python and historyhat is Python and history 
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing
and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 
Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

What Python means?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. 
It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.
The Python interpreter is called “CPython” and it's written in the C programming language. Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.

What is the benefit of Python?
Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use language. In addition, the Python community is very active. It is used in many organizations as it supports multiple programming paradigms. It also performs automatic memory management.

What is Python and why it is used?
Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, 
for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.

What is compiler in Python?
Python Compilers | Best Python Compilers for Effective ...
In the context of Python, a compiler is a software tool that translates Python code written in high-level human-readable form into low-level machine code or bytecode that can be executed directly by a computer. The compiled code is typically more efficient and faster to execute than the original Python source code.

What are the 7 operators in Python?
Python divides the operators in the following groups:
Arithmetic operators.
Assignment operators.
Comparison operators.
Logical operators.
Identity operators.
Membership operators.
Bitwise operators.

Arithmetic Operators
Definition
The arithmetic operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus operations.

Addition	+	Adds one operand to the other
Subtraction	-	Subtracts the second operand from the first
Multiplication	*	Multiplies one operand by the other
Division	/	Divides the first operand by the second
Modulo	%	Divides the first INTEGER operand by the second, and returns the remainder
Exponentiation	**	Lets you refer to a number in terms of a base value and an exponent
